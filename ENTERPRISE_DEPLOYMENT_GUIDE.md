# ENTERPRISE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
## Lynk Labs Production Safety Protocol

### üéØ OVERVIEW
This document outlines the enterprise-level deployment procedures for Lynk Labs medical platform. **Every deployment to production must follow these guidelines to prevent site outages and maintain service reliability.**

---

## üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT RULES

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION IMPACT WARNING
- **Main branch = LIVE PRODUCTION**: Any push to `main` branch automatically deploys to production
- **Zero tolerance for breaking changes**: Production downtime affects patient care and business operations
- **All deployments are monitored**: Failed deployments trigger immediate alerts

---

## üìã PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE

### Step 1: Development Phase
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Complete Testing:
1. Test all affected features manually
2. Verify user workflows end-to-end
3. Check responsive design on mobile/desktop
4. Test error scenarios and edge cases
5. Verify accessibility features work
6. Test with different user roles (if applicable)
```

### Step 2: Build Verification
```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Success Criteria:
- Build exits with code 0
- No TypeScript errors
- All pages compile successfully
- Static assets generated correctly
```

### Step 3: Production Testing
```bash
# Start production server
npm run start

# Critical Path Testing:
1. Homepage loads correctly
2. User authentication works
3. Core business flows function
4. Payment processing works
5. Database operations complete
6. API endpoints respond
```

### Step 4: Git Deployment
```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with testing confirmation
git commit -m "type: description [testing-status]"

# Deploy to production
git push origin main
```

---

## üìù COMMIT MESSAGE STANDARDS

### Required Format
```bash
git commit -m "type: description [testing-status]"
```

### Testing Status Tags (MANDATORY)
- `[tested-locally-prod]` - Tested in local production build
- `[verified-user-flow]` - Complete user journey tested
- `[performance-tested]` - Performance impact verified
- `[security-reviewed]` - Security implications checked
- `[mobile-tested]` - Mobile responsiveness verified
- `[db-migration-safe]` - Database changes tested safely
- `[no-testing-required]` - Documentation/config only changes

### Examples
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add payment gateway integration [tested-locally-prod]"
git commit -m "fix: resolve order creation bug [verified-user-flow]"
git commit -m "refactor: optimize database queries [performance-tested]"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation [no-testing-required]"
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGE PROTOCOL

### When Changes Might Break Production

#### 1. Impact Assessment (MANDATORY)
Create a document listing:
- All affected components/pages
- All affected user workflows
- Potential breaking changes
- Rollback plan
- Testing strategy

#### 2. Staged Deployment Approach
```bash
# Phase 1: Deploy with feature flag OFF
git commit -m "feat: add new feature [feature-flag-disabled]"
git push origin main

# Phase 2: Monitor production, then enable
git commit -m "config: enable new feature flag [gradual-rollout]"
git push origin main
```

#### 3. Feature Flag Implementation
```typescript
// Example: Safe feature rollout
const isNewFeatureEnabled = process.env.ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE === 'true';

if (isNewFeatureEnabled) {
  // New feature code
  return <NewComponent />;
} else {
  // Existing stable code
  return <ExistingComponent />;
}
```

## üö® EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Production Breaks After Deployment

#### Immediate Response (Within 2 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Get recent commit history
git log --oneline -10

# 2. Identify breaking commit
# 3. Create immediate rollback
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git push origin main

# 4. Verify rollback successful
curl -I https://your-production-url.com
```

#### Post-Incident Actions
1. **Document the incident**
   - What broke and why
   - Timeline of events
   - Impact assessment
   - Root cause analysis

2. **Update prevention measures**
   - Add to .cursorrules file
   - Update testing checklist
   - Improve monitoring

3. **Team notification**
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update procedures

---

## üìä POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING

### Immediate Verification (Within 5 minutes)
```bash
# Automated checks
curl -I https://your-production-url.com
curl -I https://your-production-url.com/api/health

# Manual verification:
‚úÖ Homepage loads correctly
‚úÖ User authentication works
‚úÖ Test booking flow works
‚úÖ Payment processing works
‚úÖ Database queries respond
‚úÖ No console errors in browser
```

### Extended Monitoring (Within 30 minutes)
```bash
# Check application logs
# Monitor error rates
# Verify performance metrics

# Manual testing:
‚úÖ All API endpoints respond correctly
‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness maintained
‚úÖ Email notifications work
‚úÖ Background jobs running
‚úÖ Database performance normal
```

### 24-Hour Follow-up
- Review error logs for new issues
- Monitor user feedback/support tickets
- Check performance metrics
- Verify all integrations working

---

## üîß ADVANCED DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES

### Database Migration Safety
```bash
# 1. Test migration locally
npx prisma migrate dev --name "descriptive_name"

# 2. Backup production data (if applicable)
# 3. Test rollback scenario
# 4. Deploy with migration
git commit -m "feat: add user preferences table [db-migration-safe]"
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations
```typescript
// Use environment variables for feature flags
const config = {
  enableNewFeature: process.env.ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE === 'true',
  paymentGateway: process.env.PAYMENT_GATEWAY || 'test',
  databaseUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
};

// Validate required environment variables
if (!config.databaseUrl) {
  throw new Error('DATABASE_URL is required');
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Add performance monitoring to critical paths
console.time('order-creation');
const order = await createOrder(orderData);
console.timeEnd('order-creation');

// Monitor API response times
const startTime = Date.now();
const result = await apiCall();
const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
if (duration > 5000) {
  console.warn(`Slow API call: ${duration}ms`);
}
```
