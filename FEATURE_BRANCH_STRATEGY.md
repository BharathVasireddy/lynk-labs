# FEATURE BRANCH STRATEGY GUIDE
## Enterprise-Level Git Workflow for Maximum Production Safety

### 🎯 OVERVIEW
This strategy provides **maximum safety** by requiring code review and testing before production deployment.

---

## 🌿 BRANCH STRUCTURE

### **Branch Types:**
- `main` - **Production branch** (protected, auto-deploys)
- `develop` - **Integration branch** (optional, for team coordination)
- `feature/*` - **Feature branches** (individual features/fixes)
- `hotfix/*` - **Emergency fixes** (critical production issues)

---

## 🚀 WORKFLOW PROCESS

### **1. Creating Feature Branch**
```bash
# Start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-payment-method
# or
git checkout -b fix/order-creation-bug
# or
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix
```

### **2. Development Process**
```bash
# Work on your feature
# Make commits as needed
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement payment method validation"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/add-payment-method
```

### **3. Pre-Pull Request Testing**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Test locally before creating PR
npm run dev     # Development testing
npm run build   # Production build
npm run start   # Production runtime testing

# Verify all tests pass
npm test        # If you have tests
npx tsc --noEmit # TypeScript check
```

### **4. Create Pull Request**
```bash
# Create PR via GitHub/GitLab interface
# Title: "feat: Add new payment method integration"
# Description: Include testing checklist
```

### **5. Pull Request Review Process**
- **Code review** by team member
- **Automated checks** (if configured)
- **Manual testing** by reviewer
- **Approval** required before merge

### **6. Merge to Production**
```bash
# After PR approval, merge to main
# This triggers automatic deployment
```

## ⚙️ VERCEL CONFIGURATION

### **Option A: Keep Main Branch Deployment**
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": true,
      "feature/*": false
    }
  }
}
```

### **Option B: Add Preview Deployments**
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": true,
      "feature/*": true
    }
  }
}
```
This creates preview URLs for feature branches for testing.

## 🔒 BRANCH PROTECTION RULES

### **GitHub Branch Protection (Recommended):**
1. Go to Repository Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators (optional)

### **Protection Benefits:**
- **No direct pushes** to main branch
- **Required code review** before deployment
- **Automated checks** must pass
- **Up-to-date branches** required

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY HOTFIX PROCESS

### **For Critical Production Issues:**
```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix

# Make minimal fix
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: resolve critical security vulnerability [emergency-fix]"

# Push and create urgent PR
git push origin hotfix/critical-security-fix

# Create PR with "URGENT" label
# Get immediate review and merge
```

---

## 📊 WORKFLOW COMPARISON

### **Main Branch Direct Push:**
✅ **Pros:** Fast, simple, less overhead
❌ **Cons:** Higher risk, no review, immediate production

### **Feature Branch + PR:**
✅ **Pros:** Code review, safer, team collaboration, preview deployments
❌ **Cons:** Slightly slower, more process

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR SETUP

### **For Solo Development:**
- **Keep main branch deployment** with strict safety protocols
- Use the `MAIN_BRANCH_SAFETY_PROTOCOL.md` religiously
- Consider feature branches for major changes only

### **For Team Development:**
- **Implement feature branch strategy** immediately
- Set up branch protection rules
- Use pull request template
- Enable preview deployments for testing

### **Hybrid Approach:**
```bash
# Small changes: Direct to main (with safety protocol)
git commit -m "fix: minor styling issue [tested-locally-prod]"
git push origin main

# Major changes: Feature branch + PR
git checkout -b feature/major-payment-overhaul
# ... development work ...
# Create PR for review
```

---

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### **To Implement Feature Branch Strategy:**

1. **Set up branch protection:**
   - GitHub/GitLab repository settings
   - Require PR reviews

2. **Create PR template:**
   - Add `.github/pull_request_template.md`

3. **Update team workflow:**
   - Train team on new process
   - Document in README

4. **Configure Vercel:**
   - Update deployment settings
   - Enable preview deployments

5. **Test the workflow:**
   - Create test feature branch
   - Make small change
   - Create PR and merge

---

**Recommendation: Start with your current main branch setup using the safety protocol, then gradually move to feature branches as your team grows or for high-risk changes.**
